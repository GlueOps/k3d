## Requirements:
- Get a cloud server that is either debian/ubuntu. You can use [AWS](https://cde.glueops.dev) or Hetzner (Recommended for cost savings).
- Login to your server using whatever method you like (SSH or password is fine) but you must login with a root or a user that has sudo access.
- Run: `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlueOps/development-only-utilities/main/tools/developer-setup/linux-setup.sh)
- Once you finish following the prompts and the server reboots, you will need to connect to it using your private ssh key with the `glueops` username.
- Once logged in just run `dev` and select the version you want (newest is recommended) and go ahead and get started to get a code tunnel/space going.
